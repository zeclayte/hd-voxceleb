# Computing with Hypervectors for Speaker Identification
Use an N-gram based model (based on the priciples of Hyperdimensional Computing) to learn the statistics of acoustic signals over both time and frequency so that the unique pronunciation variations (courses of formants over time) between speakers can be captured.

# Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repo directory.
3. Navigate into the repo and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the VoxCleb1 dataset of 1,251 speakers from https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Evgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html and place the data folders (id10001, id10002, id10003, ...) inside the repo directory
5. Running the demo notebook: `HD_VoxCeleb_release.ipynb`
